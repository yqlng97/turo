# Turo Car Sharing: Save 25–35% on Rentals, Pick the Exact Car You Want, Skip the Counter

So here's the thing — I used to dread renting a car at the airport. You know how it goes. You land after a long flight, drag your suitcase through the terminal, and then you're stuck in a line at the rental counter for 20 minutes just to find out the "midsize sedan" they gave you is a beige Nissan Sentra that smells like someone's lunch. And the price? Don't even get me started.

Then a friend told me about Turo. And I thought — okay, that sounds a little weird. Rent a car from a stranger? But then I actually looked into it, and now I genuinely don't understand why I ever went back to the big rental companies for anything beyond the basics.

Let me break it down for you.

## What Actually Is Turo?

Turo is a peer-to-peer car sharing marketplace. Think Airbnb, but instead of renting someone's spare bedroom, you're renting someone's actual car. Private car owners — called "hosts" — list their vehicles on the platform, set their own prices, and regular people — "guests" — book them directly through Turo's app or website.

It launched back in 2010 (originally called RelayRides) out of Boston, and it's grown into the world's largest car sharing marketplace. As of late 2024, Turo reported 150,000 active hosts globally, 350,000 vehicle listings, and 3.5 million active guests. The platform operates across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.

The model is pretty simple: you search for a car near your destination, pick one you actually like, book it, and either pick it up from the host or sometimes have it delivered to you. No counter. No paperwork shuffling. No guessing what car you'll end up with.

## Why People Are Switching from Traditional Rentals

Here's the number that made me sit up: Turo is typically 25–35% cheaper than traditional car rentals. That's not a rounding error. That's real money, especially on longer trips.

But the savings story is only half of it. The other half is choice. At Hertz or Avis, you're picking a *category*. "Midsize." "Full-size." "SUV." And then you walk to the lot and hope for the best. On Turo, you choose the exact car. Want a Tesla Model Y for your road trip? There it is. A Jeep Wrangler for a weekend in the mountains? Done. A convertible for driving the Pacific Coast Highway? You've got options.

If you've ever thought about buying an EV or upgrading to a luxury car, Turo doubles as an extended test drive. You get to live with the car for a few days, not just circle the dealership lot for 15 minutes.

And speed-wise, according to the J.D. Power 2025 North America Rental Car Satisfaction Study, customers who bypass the rental counter save nearly eight minutes on average and report significantly higher satisfaction scores — 704 compared to 662 on a 1,000-point scale.

## How Much Does It Actually Cost? Real Price Examples

Prices on Turo vary because every host sets their own rate. But here's a snapshot of what you're looking at based on current listings:

### Short-Term (3-Day) Rentals

| Vehicle | Year | 3-Day Price | Per Day |

## Guest Protection Plans: What They Cost and What They Cover

This is the part people always ask about. Turo isn't a rental company in the traditional sense, so insurance works a little differently. Every trip comes with liability coverage, but you also choose a protection plan that determines how much you'd be on the hook for if the car gets damaged.

All guest plans provide the same $750,000 liability coverage through Travelers but vary in the out-of-pocket expenses a guest is responsible for if the car is damaged.

| Protection Plan | Cost | Your Max Out-of-Pocket (Physical Damage) | Liability Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Premier** | 65–100% of trip price (min. $14/day) | $0 | Up to $750K |
| **Standard** | 40% of trip price (min. $12/day) | $500 | Up to $750K |
| **Minimum** | ~10% of trip price (min. $10/day) | $3,000 | Up to $750K |
| **Decline** | $0 | Full responsibility | State minimum only |

The Premier plan offers the highest level of protection — the primary guest pays no out-of-pocket costs for reported physical damage, excluding eligible mechanical or interior damage. The Standard plan limits the guest's out-of-pocket responsibility for physical damage to $500, and a $500 damage deposit is collected upfront and refunded if damages fall below that amount or are ineligible.

One thing worth knowing: most travel credit cards do not offer coverage for ride-sharing companies like Turo, so it's worth checking with your card issuer before you skip the protection plan entirely.

## Ways to Save Even More

Turo doesn't run big sitewide sales the way Amazon or Best Buy does. But there are still solid ways to cut your cost down:

**New user credit:** First-time users can get $25 off their initial booking. Easy win just for signing up.

**Referral program:** When someone signs up using your referral link and completes their first trip, you both win — they get $25 off, and you earn $25 in credit for future bookings.

**Book longer trips:** The math here is pretty straightforward. Hosts offer better daily rates for weekly and monthly bookings, and some of those savings are enormous — we're talking hundreds of dollars per month on longer rentals.

**Early bird discounts:** Some hosts provide "Early Bird" discounts when you book more than a week in advance. It pays to plan ahead, especially during peak travel seasons.

**Credit card perks:** The AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite card provides up to $180 in statement credits (up to $30 per booking) on Turo trips through October 18, 2026. And Turo often has Amex Offers for eligible cardholders as well. Also, Turo rentals code as travel purchases, so you can earn bonus points on cards that pay extra for travel spending.

**Rakuten cash back:** Turo is listed on Rakuten, where you can earn 2% Cash Back on your rental.

**Community promo codes:** Sites like SimplyCodes and CouponFollow regularly track working Turo codes. As of January 2026, codes like **TUROFLEET10** and **TURORENTAL10** have been reported as working by community members. Always worth a quick check before you checkout — just keep in mind Turo does not allow customers to stack coupons, so make sure you find the best promo code available to maximize your savings.
